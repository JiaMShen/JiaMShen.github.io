  <p style = "font-size:18px;">I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in <a href = "http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Jiawei Han</a>'s <a href="http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Data Mining Group</a>, Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to UIUC, I received my bachelor degree from <a href = "http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, under the supervision of <a href = "http://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/personal/xwang8/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Xinbing Wang</a>, and I was a member of <a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm" target = "_blank">IEEE Honored Class</a>.

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">My research focuses on <b>constructing multi-faceted taxonomy</b> from massive unstructured text corpora and <b>enhancing text understanding</b> with constructed taxonomies. My works lay in the intersection of data mining, natural language processing and information retrieval.</p>
